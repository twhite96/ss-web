A brief post here.

Getting into Home Assistant has been the best thing to happen to me in a long time. It has not only been fun, but as a software engineer by trade, it has made me better at my job and understanding the pipes that gird all the infrastructure I build apps on top of.

It's taken me a little under two years to feel comfortable with terms like:

- Proxmox
- NGINX
- NGINX Proxy Manager
- Docker
- Portainter
- VMs
- Bittorrent
- How to tunnel traffic securely by using Cloudflare and NPM to and from Home Assistant

and more.

These were terms I'd heard of but never understood and was too scared to find out more about.

Now I have a small home lab and switches everywhere.

I am neurodivergent and these past three years have been incredibly difficult for me. Diving into Home Assistant, DevOps, and building apps has literally saved my life more times than I can count.

## Welp

That got a bit mushy at the end there innit.

But it's true. And at the end of the day, it's *fun*.
